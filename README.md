# Language Exploration

This is a repo where I'm gonna mess around with writing programming languages and interpreters!
Right now there's just JLox (new name pending), an interpreter made following along with 
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/representing-code.html) and making my own tweaks. It's an
inferred-type, class-based, object-oriented/imperative scripting language with C-like and Swift-like syntax. I may
also follow along with the CLox part of Crafting Interpreters at a later date.
